The Fortune Teller part 2
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
Write a function named tellFortune that:
- takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
*/
	var kids = prompt("How many children would you like to have?");
	var pName = prompt("What is your partners name?");
	var place = prompt("Where would you like to live?");
	var job = prompt("What is your dream job title?");
	
	myFunction1(job, place, pName, kids);

	function myFunction1(job, place, pName, kids) {
    return alert("KAZAM! You will be a " + job + " in " + place + ", and married to " + pName + " with " + kids + " kids.");
}     
	/*
The Age Calculator part 2
Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
Write a function named calculateAge that:
- takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
- calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
- outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
- Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
*/
	var d = new Date();
	var n = d.getFullYear();
	var birthYear = prompt("What year where you born?");
	var age1 = n - birthYear;
	var age2 = 1 + (n - birthYear);

myFunction2(age1, age2);

	function myFunction2(age1, age2) {
    return alert ("You are either " + age1 + " or " + age2);
	}	
		/*
The Lifetime Supply Calculator part 2
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
- takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
- calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
- outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
- Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
- Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
*/
	var currentAge1 = prompt("What is you current age?");
	var oldAge1 = prompt("How old do you expect to live?");
	var snack = prompt("What is your favorit snack?");
	var snackCount = prompt("How many " + snack + " do you eat per day?");
	var totalSnack = ((oldAge1 - currentAge1) * 365) * snackCount;

		
	myFunction3(totalSnack, oldAge1);

	function myFunction3(totalSnack, oldAge1) {
    return alert("You will need " + totalSnack + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + oldAge1 + ".");
	}
		/*
The Geometrizer part 2
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:
http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm
Create a function called calcCircumfrence:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
*/
	var radius1 = prompt("What is the radius of your circle?");
	var circumference1 = 2 * Math.PI * radius1;
	var area1 = radius1 * radius1 * Math.PI;

		myFunction4(circumference1, area1);

	function myFunction4(circumference1, area1) {
    return alert("The circumference is " + circumference1 + ". The area is " + area1 + ".");	
}

    	/*
The Temperature Converter part 2
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
*/
	var celsius1 = prompt("What is the temperature in Celsius?");
	var fahrenheit1 = (celsius1 * (9/5)) + 32;
		

			myFunction5(celsius1, fahrenheit1);

	function myFunction5(celsius1, fahrenheit1) {
    return alert(celsius1 + " degrees Celsius is " + fahrenheit1 + " degrees Fahrenheit.");
	}	
	
	var fahrenheit1 = prompt("What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?");
	var celsius1 = (fahrenheit1 - 32) * (5/9);
		
			myFunction6(fahrenheit1, celsius1);

	function myFunction6(fahrenheit1, celsius1) {
    return alert(fahrenheit1 + " degrees Fahrenheit is " + celsius1 + " degrees Celsius.");
	}
