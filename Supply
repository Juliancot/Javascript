	2. The Lifetime Supply Calculator
	Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
	- Store your current age into a variable.
	- Store a maximum age into a variable.
	- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
	- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
	- Output the result to the screen like so:
	"You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".
	*/
	var currentAge1 = prompt("What is you current age?");
	var oldAge1 = prompt("How old do you expect to live?");
	var snack = prompt("What is your favorit snack?");
	var snackCount = prompt("How many " + snack + " do you eat per day?");
	var totalSnack = ((oldAge1 - currentAge1) * 365) * snackCount;

		alert("You will need " + totalSnack + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + oldAge1 + ".");
